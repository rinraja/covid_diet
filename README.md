#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
COVID-19 has completely transformed the world and every aspect of life has become centered around it. Since the majority of people are staying at home, it is important that everyone is doing their best to prevent the spread of COVID-19. There have been several guidelines put into place such as social distancing and mask mandates, however people can still do their part by staying healthy and boosting their immunity. People at home need to do their part so that all of the hospitals are not being overcrowded. One way to stay healthy is to have a well-rounded diet and this project analyzes the percentage of people in the world eating different food groups and how those groups might have impacted COVID-19 death rates. 

### Methods Used
* Data Visualization

### Technologies
* Python
  * Plotly 
  * Pandas

## Project Description
* Data set was obtained from [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mariaren/covid19-healthy-diet-dataset). 
  * The majority of columns in the dataset include the percentage of daily intake of people from a particular country. These percentages were calculated based off of the recommended daily intake provided by the USDA Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion. There are several different food categories that have been included such as milk, vegetables, fruits, meat products, vegetable oil, etc. The last few columns contain information about the obesity rates, covid cases, covid deaths, and total population within each country.
* Visualizations of obesity rates and COVID-19 death counts were graphed on each continet
* The breakdown of each food category was graphed on a stacked bar plot for the most populated countries from each continent
